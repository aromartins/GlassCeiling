# jobTalk

Welcome to the jobTalk project! Thanks for stopping by!

## What are we doing?
We are building a professional development platform for academics, focused on workplace reviews and network building. Think glassdoor for a rather unique workforce. 

### The problem 
Academics are a vulnerable workforce, with very little information around hiring and workplace practices. Universities increasingly exploit academics (e.g. the ongoing adjunct professor debacle) and encourage a highly toxic work environment, resulting in a vicious cycle of old boys clubs. 

We want to change that.

### The solution

By bringing transparency and accountability to academic workplaces, we hope to give academics a place to publicly voice their concerns, share solutions, and find mentors and allies. Users can share salary and negotiation information so job seekers have more leverage. Universities will be held accountable for maintaining environments that academics *want to work in*, which are also *safe for students and early career academics*. 

While sites like glassdoor are helpful for professionals, academic positions often come with a dozen hidden variables, depending on the field (teaching load, lab space, childcare leave rules, startup package, etc). Not to mention, hiring practices may vary wildly across institutions/borders. We envision users will use this platform to share workplace reviews across categories ranging from compensation to parenting support to mentorship. We hope to help users to develop robust mentoring and support networks, and empower them with the information they need to succeed.

Research is uncertain enough, let's bring more transparency to academic workplaces!

Check out a mockup of the site [here](https://github.com/voxverus//blob/master/jobTalk%20mockup.pdf).

## Who are we?

We are Raquel Martins and Kelly Clancy, two scientists who want to help make academia a more inclusive place, and to help academics get the most out of their careers. We're proud members of the current <a href='https://medium.com/@MozOpenLeaders'>Mozilla Open Leaders cohort.</a>

## What do we need?

Your help! We're looking for web developers and designers of all skill levels to help build the site. We could use input on any of these issues: web/user experience design, database maintenance and data protection, documentation, maintenance, all the things.  Because this project will be most useful if lots of people use it, we'd also love input from people with knowledge of marketing, fundraising, advertising and the like to help get the word out and to get users! Finally, if you have expertise about academic work practices in a certain field and can advise about what information we should collect, please get in touch! (We know the general ropes for biology, but practices in the humanities, math, engineering, etc. are more mysterious--every field has different norms!)

The core functionality we see as follows: users can submit detailed (very anonymous) workplace reviews, search and filter workplaces by best/worst/citycountry/etc, and ideally log in to connect with ongoing discussions, mentoring, etc. This will require some slick data security practices.
