# To Do

This is a detailed task list for developing the jobtalk site. See [mockup](https://github.com/voxverus/JobTalk/blob/master/jobTalk%20mockup.pdf) for site vision.

## Backend
### Reviews submission
* See flow in [mockup](https://github.com/voxverus/JobTalk/blob/master/jobTalk%20mockup.pdf)
  * Anonmymized database - once user goes into the review page no profile info is kept associated to their entries
  * Strip text entries of possible identifying information
  * Search page to filter reviews by institution/country/high/low rank

### Social network aspect/personal profile page
* form for entry of:
  * basic personal info 
  * General interestes (professional and personal)
  * interests whithin the metrics the reviews will be measuring 
  (for details see in [mockup](https://github.com/voxverus/JobTalk/blob/master/jobTalk%20mockup.pdf) 

## Front
* simple /clean look: 
  *top  half should be website name, logo, vision blurb; (thoughts on designing a logo/ the look of the page welcomed)
  *bottom half should have placeholder spaces to Link data from review pages once users populate (e.g. best ranked workplaces)
